##<a id='install'></a> Step 1: Install PKS

<%= partial 'install-pks' %>

##<a id='configure'></a> Step 2: Configure PKS

Click the orange **Pivotal Container Service** tile to start the configuration process.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Configuration of NSX-T or Flannel <strong>cannot</strong> be changed after initial installation and configuration of PKS.</p>

![Pivotal Container Service tile on the Ops Manager installation dashboard](images/pks-tile-orange.png)

  <p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: When you configure the PKS tile,
  do not use spaces in any field entries. This includes spaces between characters as well as
  leading and trailing spaces. If you use a space in any field entry, the deployment of PKS fails.</p>

###<a id='azs-networks'></a> Assign AZs and Networks

Perform the following steps:

1. Click **Assign AZs and Networks**.

1. Select the availability zone (AZ) where you want to deploy the PKS API VM as a singleton job.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must select an additional AZ for balancing other jobs before clicking <strong>Save</strong>, but this selection has no effect in the current version of PKS.</p>

    ![Assign AZs and Networks pane in Ops Manager](images/azs-networks.png)

1. Under **Network**, select the PKS Management Network linked to the `ls-pks-mgmt` NSX-T logical switch you created in the [Create Networks Page](vsphere-nsxt-om-config.html#create-networks) step of _Configuring Ops Manager on vSphere with NSX-T Integration_. This will provide network placement for the PKS API VM.
1. Under **Service Network**, your selection depends on whether you are upgrading from a previous PKS version or installing an original PKS deployment.
  * If you are deploying PKS with NSX-T for the first time, the **Service Network** field does not apply because PKS creates the service network for you during the installation process. However, the PKS tile requires you to make a selection. Therefore, select the same network you specified in the **Network** field.
  * If you are upgrading from a previous PKS version, select the **Service Network** linked to the `ls-pks-service` NSX-T logical switch that is created by PKS during installation. The service network provides network placement for the already existing on-demand Kubernetes cluster service instances created by the PKS broker.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='networking'></a> Networking

To configure networking, do the following:

1. Click **Networking**.
1. Under **Container Networking Interface**, select **NSX-T**.
  ![NSX-T Networking configuration pane in PKS tile](images/networking-nsx-t.png)
  1. For **NSX Manager hostname**, enter the hostname or IP address of your NSX Manager.
  1. For **NSX Manager Super User Principal Identify Certificate**, copy and paste the contents and private key of the Principal Identity certificate you created in [Generating and Registering the NSX Manager Superuser Principal Identity Certificate and Key](generate-nsx-pi-cert.html).
  1. For **NSX Manager CA Cert**, copy and paste the contents of the NSX Manager CA certificate you created in [Generating and Registering the NSX Manager Certificate](generate-nsx-ca-cert.html). Use this certificate and key to connect to the NSX Manager.
  1. The **Disable SSL certificate verification** checkbox is **not** selected by default. In order to disable TLS verification, select the checkbox. You may want to disable TLS verification if you did not enter a CA certificate, or if your CA certificate is self-signed.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>NSX Manager CA Cert</strong> field and the <strong>Disable SSL certificate verification</strong> option are intended to be mutually exclusive. If you disable SSL certificate verification, leave the CA certificate field blank. If you enter a certificate in the <strong>NSX Manager CA Cert</strong> field, do not disable SSL certificate verification. If you populate the certificate field and disable certificate validation, insecure mode takes precedence.</p>
  1. If you are using a NAT deployment topology, leave the **NAT mode** checkbox selected. If you are using a No-NAT topology, clear this checkbox. For more information, see [Deployment Topologies](nsxt-topologies.html).
  1. Enter the following IP Block settings:
      <img src="images/networking-nsx-t-2.png" alt="NSX-T Networking configuration pane in Ops Manager" width="375">
      * **Pods IP Block ID**: Enter the UUID of the IP block to be used for Kubernetes pods. PKS allocates IP addresses for the pods when they are created in Kubernetes. Each time a namespace is created in Kubernetes, a subnet from this IP block is allocated. The current subnet size that is created is /24, which means a maximum of 256 pods can be created per namespace.
      * **Nodes IP Block ID**: Enter the UUID of the IP block to be used for Kubernetes nodes. PKS allocates IP addresses for the nodes when they are created in Kubernetes. The node networks are created on a separate IP address space from the pod networks. The current subnet size that is created is /24, which means a maximum of 256 nodes can be created per cluster.
      For more information, including sizes and the IP blocks to avoid using, see [Plan IP Blocks](nsxt-prepare-env.html#plan-ip-blocks) in _Preparing NSX-T Before Deploying PKS_.
  1. For **T0 Router ID**, enter the `t0-pks` T0 router UUID. Locate this value in the NSX-T UI router overview.
  1. For **Floating IP Pool ID**, enter the `ip-pool-vips` ID that you created for load balancer VIPs. For more information, see [Plan Network CIDRs](nsxt-prepare-env.html#plan-cidrs). PKS uses the floating IP pool to allocate IP addresses to the load balancers created for each of the clusters. The load balancer routes the API requests to the master nodes and the data plane.
  1. For **Nodes DNS**, enter one or more Domain Name Servers used by the Kubernetes nodes.
  1. For **vSphere Cluster Names**, enter a comma-separated list of the vSphere clusters where you will deploy Kubernetes clusters.
  The NSX-T pre-check errand uses this field to verify that the hosts from the specified clusters are available in NSX-T. You can specify clusters in this format: `cluster1,cluster2,cluster3`.
1. (Optional) Configure a global proxy for all outgoing HTTP and HTTPS traffic from your Kubernetes clusters and the PKS API server. See [Using Proxies with PKS on NSX-T](proxies.html) for instructions on how to enable a proxy.
1. Under **Allow outbound internet access from Kubernetes cluster vms (IaaS-dependent)**, ignore the **Enable outbound internet access** checkbox.
1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='usage'></a> Usage Data

<%= partial 'usage-data' %>

###<a id='errands'></a> Errands

Errands are scripts that run at designated points during an installation.

To configure when post-deploy and pre-delete errands for PKS are run, make a selection in the dropdown next to the errand.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: You must enable the NSX-T Validation errand to verify and tag required NSX-T objects.</p>

  ![Errand configuration pane](images/nsxt/nsxt-validation-errand-ON.png)

For more information about errands and their configuration state, see [Managing Errands in Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/managing_errands.html).

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING</strong>: Because PKS uses floating stemcells, updating the PKS tile with a new stemcell triggers the rolling of every VM in each cluster. Also, updating other product tiles in your deployment with a new stemcell causes the PKS tile to roll VMs. This rolling is enabled by the <strong>Upgrade all clusters errand</strong>. We recommend that you keep this errand turned on because automatic rolling of VMs ensures that all deployed cluster VMs are patched. However, automatic rolling can cause downtime in your deployment.</p>

###<a id='resource-config'></a> Resource Config

To modify the resource usage of PKS, click **Resource Config** and edit the **Pivotal Container Service** job.

![Resource pane configuration](images/resources-vsphere.png)

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you experience timeouts or slowness when interacting with the PKS API, select a <strong>VM Type</strong> with greater CPU and memory resources for the <strong>Pivotal Container Service</strong> job.</p>

## <a id='apply-changes'></a> Step 3: Apply Changes

After configuring the PKS tile, follow the steps below to deploy the tile:

<%= partial 'apply-changes' %>

## <a id='clis'></a> Step 4: Install the PKS and Kubernetes CLIs

<%= partial 'install-cli' %>

## <a id='retrieve-endpoint'></a>Step 5: Verify NAT Rules

If you are using NAT mode, verify that you have created the required NAT rules for the PKS Management Plane. See [Creating the PKS Management Plane](nsxt-prepare-mgmt-plane.html) for details.

In addition, for NAT and no-NAT modes, verify that you created the required NAT rule for Kubernetes master nodes to access NSX Manager. See [Prepare Compute Plane](nsxt-prepare-compute-plane.html) for details.

## <a id='api'></a> Step 6: Configure PKS API Access

Follow the procedures in [Configuring PKS API Access](configure-api.html).

## <a id='auth'></a> Step 7: Configure Authentication for PKS

<%= partial 'configure-auth' %>

##<a id='next-steps'></a> Next Steps

After installing PKS on vSphere with NSX-T integration, you may want to do one or more of the following:

* <%= partial 'harbor' %>
* Create your first PKS cluster. For more information, see [Creating Clusters](create-cluster.html).
