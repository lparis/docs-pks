<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to use BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR) to back up a cluster
deployed by <%= vars.product_full %>.

To restore a cluster with BBR, see the instructions in
[Restoring a Cluster](bbr-restore-cluster.html).

## <a id='limitations'></a> Limitations

BBR has the following limitations:

* BBR does not back up the contents of disks that are attached to nodes.
* BBR only backs up and restores the cluster etcd data.
This includes the cluster-deployed workloads.
Persistent volumes and other IaaS resources, such as load balancers of workloads, are not backed up.
* Backup and restore for clusters deployed on vSphere with NSX-T is not yet supported.
* For a list of components that cannot be backed up with BBR, 
see <a href="bbr-backup.html#unsupported">Unsupported Components</a>.

## <a id='prereqs'></a> Prerequisites

Before you back up clusters in <%= vars.product_short %> with BBR, you must have the following:

* SSH access to a jumpbox that can reach the BOSH Director or SSH access to the Ops Manager VM of your deployment.
* A version of BBR that is compatible with this <%= vars.product_short %> release. 
For required minimum version information, see the [<%= vars.product_short %> Release Notes](release-notes.html).
    * To see what version of BBR you have installed, run the following command:
      
        ```
        bbr v
        ```
    * If you do not have BBR installed, see [Installing BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html).
* BOSH credentials that limit the scope of BBR activity to your cluster deployments.
See [Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS](#cluster-bbr-credentials).
* Access to the root CA certificate for your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment. 
See [Download the Root CA Certificate](#download-certificate).
* Cluster deployments that can be backed up. See [Verify Your Cluster Deployments](#verify-deployments).

### <a id='retrieve-bosh-address'></a> Retrieve BOSH Director Address

Your BOSH Director may have a custom hostname. To retrieve the hostname, perform the following steps:

1. From the Installation Dashboard in Ops Manager, click the **BOSH Director** tile.
1. Select **Director Config** and record the value of the **Director Hostname** field.

If your BOSH Director does not have a hostname, perform the following steps to retrieve the IP address:

1. From the Installation Dashboard in Ops Manager, select **BOSH Director > Status**.
1. Record the IP address listed for the Director. You access the BOSH Director using this IP address.

### <a id='cluster-bbr-credentials'></a> Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS

You must use BOSH credentials that limit the scope of BBR activity to your cluster deployments. 

To obtain these credentials, perform the following steps:

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click the **<%= vars.product_tile %>** tile.

1. Select the **Credentials** tab.

1. Navigate to **Credentials > UAA Client Credentials**. 

1. Record the value for `uaa_client_secret`.

1. Record the value for `uaa_client_name`.

### <a id='download-certificate'></a> Download or Locate the Root CA Certificate

If you are running BBR from a jumpbox, download the root certificate authority (CA) 
certificate for your <%= vars.product_short %> deployment by following the
steps below.

1. From the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard, click your username in the top right corner.

1. Navigate to **Settings > Advanced**.

1. Click **Download Root CA Cert**.

If you are running BBR from the Ops Manager VM, the root CA certificate is 
located in the following location:

```
/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
```

### <a id='verify-deployments'></a> Verify Your Cluster Deployments

To verify that you can reach your BOSH Director and that the BOSH Director has PKS cluster deployments that
can be backed up, follow the steps below.

1. SSH into your jumpbox. For more information about the jumpbox, see [Installing BOSH Backup and Restore](bbr-install.html#jumpbox-setup).

1. To perform the BBR pre-backup check, run the following command from your jumpbox:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=PKS-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET \
    bbr deployment \
    --all-deployments \
    --target BOSH-TARGET \
    --username PKS-UAA-CLIENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    pre-backup-check
    ```
    Replace the placeholder text as follows:
    * `PKS-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET`: Enter the value you recorded for `uaa_client_secret` in 
      [Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS](#cluster-bbr-credentials).
    * `BOSH-TARGET`: Enter the value you recorded for the BOSH Director's address in 
      [Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-bosh-address).
      You must be able to reach the target address from the machine where you run `bbr`
      commands.
    * `PKS-UAA-CLIENT-NAME`: Enter the value you recorded for `uaa_client_name` in 
      [Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS](#cluster-bbr-credentials). 
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT`: Use the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in
      [Download or Locate Root CA Certificate](#download-certificate).

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    bbr deployment \
    --all-deployments \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username pivotal-container-service-12345abcdefghijklmn \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate \
    pre-backup-check
    </pre>

1. If the pre-backup-check command is successful, the command returns a list of cluster 
   deployments that can be backed up. 

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    [21:51:23] Pending: service-instance_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-90101112131415
    [21:51:23] -------------------------
    [21:51:31] Deployment 'service-instance_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-90101112131415' can be backed up.
    [21:51:31] -------------------------
    [21:51:31] Successfully can be backed up: service-instance_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-90101112131415
    </pre>

    In the output above, `service-instance_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-90101112131415` is the 
    BOSH deployment name of a PKS cluster.

1. If the pre-backup-check command fails, do one or more of the following:
    * Make sure you are using the correct <%= vars.product_tile %> credentials.
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
      see [Exit Codes and Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Make the changes suggested in the output and run the pre-backup check again. For example,
      the deployments might not have the correct backup scripts, or the connection to
      the BOSH Director failed.

## <a id='back-up-all'></a> Back Up Cluster Deployments

To back up cluster deployments, follow the steps below.

1. To back up all cluster deployments, run the following command from your jumpbox:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=PKS-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET \
    nohup bbr deployment \
    --all-deployments \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username PKS-UAA-CLIENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    backup [--with-manifest] [--artifact-path]
    ```

    Replace the placeholder text as follows:
    * `PKS-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET`: Enter the value you recorded for `uaa_client_secret` in 
      [Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS](#cluster-bbr-credentials).
    * `BOSH-TARGET`: Enter the value you recorded for the BOSH Director's address in 
      [Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-bosh-address).
      You must be able to reach the target address from the machine where you run `bbr`
      commands.
    * `PKS-UAA-CLIENT-NAME`: Enter the value you recorded for `uaa_client_name` in 
      [Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS](#cluster-bbr-credentials). 
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT`: Use the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in
      [Download or Locate Root CA Certificate](#download-certificate).

    Specify optional flags for the `backup` subcommand:
    <ul>
      <li><code>--with-manifest</code>: This includes the manifest in the backup artifact. If you use this flag, the backup artifact then contains credentials that you should keep secret.</li>
      <li><code>--artifact-path</code>: This allows you to specify a path for the backup artifact.</li>
    </ul>

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    nohup bbr deployment \
    --all-deployments \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username pivotal-container-service-12345abcdefghijklmn \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate \
    backup
    </pre>

    <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The BBR backup command can take a long time to complete. You can run it independently of the SSH session so that the process can continue running even if your connection to the jumpbox fails. The command above uses <code>nohup</code>, but you could also run the command in a <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> session.</p>

1. To backup a single cluster deployment, run the following command from your jumpbox:

    ```
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=PKS-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET \
    nohup bbr deployment \
    --deployment CLUSTER-DEPLOYMENT-NAME \
    --target BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP \
    --username PKS-UAA-CLIENT-NAME \
    --ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-SERVER-CERT \
    backup [--with-manifest] [--artifact-path]
    ```

    Replace the placeholder text as follows:
    * `PKS-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET`: Enter the value you recorded for `uaa_client_secret` in 
      [Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS](#cluster-bbr-credentials).
    * `CLUSTER-DEPLOYMENT-NAME`: Enter the BOSH deployment name for the cluster you want
      to back up. Cluster deployment names begin with `service-instance` and contain a unique identifier.
       To view a list of clusters that can be backed up, see [Verify Your Cluster Deployments](#verify-deployments).
    * `BOSH-TARGET`: Enter the value you recorded for the BOSH Director's address in 
      [Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-bosh-address).
      You must be able to reach the target address from the machine where you run `bbr`
      commands.
    * `PKS-UAA-CLIENT-NAME`: Enter the value you recorded for `uaa_client_name` in 
      [Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS](#cluster-bbr-credentials). 
    * `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT`: Use the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in
      [Download or Locate Root CA Certificate](#download-certificate).

    Specify optional flags for the `backup` subcommand:
    <ul>
      <li><code>--with-manifest</code>: This includes the manifest in the backup artifact. If you use this flag, the backup artifact then contains credentials that you should keep secret.</li>
      <li><code>--artifact-path</code>: This allows you to specify a path for the backup artifact.</li>
    </ul>

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
    nohup bbr deployment \
    --deployment service-instance_abcdeg-1234-5678-hijk-9010111213141 \
    --target bosh.example.com \
    --username pivotal-container-service-12345abcdefghijklmn \
    --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate \
    backup
    </pre>

1. If the `backup` command completes successfully, follow the steps in [Manage Your Backup Artifact](#manage) below.

1. If the backup command fails, do one or more of the following:
    * Run the command again, adding the `--debug` flag to enable debug logs. For more information,
      see [Exit Codes and Logging](bbr-logging.html).
    * Follow the steps in [Recover from a Failing Command](#recovering-from-failing-command).

## <a id="recover"></a> Recover from a Failing Command

If your backup fails, follow these steps below:

1. Ensure that all the parameters in the command are set.

1. Ensure that the BOSH Director credentials are valid.

1. Ensure that the jumpbox can reach the BOSH Director.

1. Consult [Exit Codes and Logging](bbr-logging.html).

1. If you see the error message `Directory /var/vcap/store/bbr-backup already exists on instance`,
   run the appropriate cleanup command. See [Clean Up after a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below.

1. If the backup artifact is corrupted, discard the failing artifacts and run the backup again.

## <a id='cancel-backup'></a>Cancel a Backup

If you must cancel a backup, follow the steps below:

1. Terminate the BBR process by entering `Ctrl-C`, then entering `yes` to confirm.

1. Because stopping a backup can leave the system in an unusable state and prevent additional
backups, follow the procedures in [Clean Up after a Failed Backup](#manual-clean) below.

## <a id="manual-clean"></a>Clean Up after a Failed Backup

If you stop the backup process or the process fails, the BBR backup folder can remain on the
instance, causing any subsequent attempts to backup to fail.
In addition, if the interruption prevents BBR from running the post-backup scripts, the instance
may be left in a locked state.

If you stop the backup process or the process fails, run the following command:

```
BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=PKS-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET \
bbr deployment \
--all-deployments \
--target BOSH-TARGET \
--username PKS-UAA-CLIENT-NAME \
--ca-cert PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT \
backup-cleanup
```

Replace the placeholder text as follows:

* `PKS-UAA-CLIENT-SECRET`: Enter the value you recorded for `uaa_client_secret` in 
  [Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS](#cluster-bbr-credentials).
* `BOSH-TARGET`: Enter the value you recorded for the BOSH Director's address in 
  [Retrieve BOSH Director Address](#retrieve-bosh-address).
  You must be able to reach the target address from the machine where you run `bbr`
  commands.
* `PKS-UAA-CLIENT-NAME`: Enter the value you recorded for `uaa_client_name` in
  [Obtain and Record UAA Client Credentials for PKS](#cluster-bbr-credentials). 
* `PATH-TO-BOSH-CA-CERT`: Use the path to the root CA certificate that you downloaded in
  [Download or Locate Root CA Certificate](#download-certificate).

For example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=p455w0rd \
bbr deployment \
--all-deployments \
--target bosh.example.com \
--username pivotal-container-service-12345abcdefghijklmn \
--ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate \
backup-cleanup
</pre>

If the cleanup script fails, consult the following table to match the exit codes to an error
message.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Error</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>Success</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>General failure</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>The post-backup unlock failed. One of your deployments might be in a bad state and require
      attention.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>The cleanup failed. This is a non-fatal error indicating that the utility has been unable
      to clean up open BOSH SSH connections to a deployment's VMs. Manual cleanup might be required
      to clear any hanging BOSH users and connections.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For more information about interpreting the exit codes, see
[Exit Codes](bbr-logging.html#exit-codes) in _BBR Exit Codes and Logging_.

## <a id="manage"></a>Manage Your Backup Artifact

Keep your backup artifact safe in the following ways:

* Move the backup artifacts off the jumpbox to a secure storage space. BBR stores each backup in a
subdirectory named `DEPLOYMENT-TIMESTAMP` within the current working directory. The backup created
by BBR consists of a folder that contains the backup artifacts and metadata files.

* Compress and encrypt the backup artifacts when storing them.

* Make redundant copies of your backup and store them in multiple locations. This can help
minimize the risk of losing your backups in the event of a disaster.

* Each time you redeploy a cluster, test your backup artifact by following the procedures in
[Restore a Cluster](bbr-restore-cluster.html).
